Worker threads in Node.js or Web Workers in a browser utilize multiple CPU cores automatically for parallel execution.

1. How Worker Threads Use CPU Cores?

• Worker Threads or Web Workers run as separate threads within the same process.
• They are managed by the underlying operating system’s thread scheduler and can execute independently on different CPU cores, enabling true parallel execution.


2. Node.js and Worker Threads

• By default, Node.js is single-threaded (using its event loop for async operations), but its "worker_threads" module allows creation of additional threads.
• Node.js relies on the OS scheduler to distribute the workers across all CPU cores.


3. Why You See Workers on All Cores Automatically

This is because of how the OS and JavaScript runtime manage threads:
	1. OS Scheduler: The operating system ensures threads are executed on different cores to maximize parallelism.
	2. Worker Pool Management: Node.js uses a worker thread pool to offload tasks to available cores.


4. Benefits of Automatic Core Utilization

• True Parallelism: Workers can run simultaneously on multiple cores, improving performance for CPU-bound tasks.
• No Manual Core Assignment: Developers don’t need to specify which core a thread should run on; the OS handles this automatically.
• Scalability: As you add more cores, your application can scale by spawning additional worker threads.


5. Browser Web Workers

• Web Workers also rely on the OS scheduler to run in separate threads and utilize available CPU cores. While the main thread handles UI updates, Web Workers handle background tasks independently on different cores.


6. Practical Implications

• If your workload is CPU-bound (e.g., computationally heavy tasks like image processing, machine learning), workers spread across cores will ensure maximum utilization.

• The number of workers you spawn should align with the number of CPU cores to avoid contention:
	* Use os.cpus().length in Node.js to determine the core count.
	* In the browser, this is reflected by navigator.hardwareConcurrency.
	

SOME EXTRA:
------------

Web Workers (a Web API) and Worker Threads in Node.js (a C++ API) are designed to communicate with the operating system to efficiently utilize multiple CPU cores for parallel execution. This kind of optimization leverages the capabilities of the runtime environment.

Keeping the number of worker threads in sync with the available CPU cores is a crucial practice to ensure optimal performance. When you spawn too many threads, it can lead to contention where multiple threads compete for CPU time, ultimately degrading system performance.


JavaScript environments, like Node.js, indeed handle a lot of the complexity under the hood. They automatically offload threads to multiple cores and can spawn new processes to optimize performance further. This automation is great for ease of use but does mean you have less manual control compared to some other programming environments.

Given this, it's indeed wise to align the number of worker threads with the available CPU cores. This way, you can avoid issues like contention where too many threads compete for CPU time, leading to potential performance degradatio
